## 🧠 GOAT Platform Terminology

Understand the key concepts that power the GOAT platform — a new way to gamify fandom through PvP prediction markets.

| Term               | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **GOAT**           | The PvP betting layer built on **Chiliz**, designed to gamify sports fandom. |
| **Markets**        | Player or stat-based prediction opportunities where fans place their bets. |
| **Odds Logic**     | Powered by a **liquidity-based AMM**, adjusting odds dynamically based on user positions. |
| **PvP Model**      | Fans bet **against each other**, not the house — fully peer-to-peer. |
| **Chaser**         | The in-app stable unit (soft-dollar) that acts as a **bridge between all fan tokens**. |
| **Tournaments**    | Competitive events based on points or wins with prizes, leaderboards, and more. |
| **Tournament Types** | Includes **Gated**, **Private**, **Premium**, and **Open** formats — each with unique access rules. |
| **Who Earns?**     | LPs (coming soon), market creators, the protocol itself, and referrers all get a share. |

GOAT is a gamified, social betting layer built for true sports lovers. It turns raw passion into action. Bet with friends, back your instincts, and feel every moment like never before.
It’s permissionless — meaning anyone can create a market and let others join in. No house. No limits. Just fans betting on greatness.

## 🪙 What is Chaser?

Chaser is the in-app currency used to bet on athletes.

### Here’s how it works:

- Swap your fan tokens into Chaser instantly

- Use **Chaser** to enter markets and place bets

- You can swap back anytime to your original token (like $CHZ or any supported asset)

### Chaser is your game-ready currency — swap in, bet big, cash out.

## 📈 What are Markets?

A Market is a bet on a specific player stat or event.

### It can look like:

- ⚽ Will Mbappé score 2 goals in the first half? → Yes / No

- 🆚 Who scores first: Haaland or Mbappé? → Player Duel

- 🏀 Will LeBron make the next free throw? → Live Market

Each market has 2 or more outcomes. You choose your side using Chasers (our in-app betting token).

If your prediction is correct when the market closes — you win the pot. If you're wrong — your stake goes to the winners.
