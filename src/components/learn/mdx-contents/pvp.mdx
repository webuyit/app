# GOAT uses a liquidity-based pricing model — kind of like how AMMs (automated market makers) work in DeFi.

## Here’s the vibe:

- 📊 Users bet on the outcome they believe in

- 💡 The odds adjust dynamically based on total bets placed

- ⚖️ The more people bet on one side, the lower the rewards for that side
- 🏀 Everyone places bets into a shared pool for a specific stat (e.g., “Will Player X get 10+ rebounds?”)

- 🪙 After the event is resolved, the winning side splits the pool — based on how much each person staked

So if most fans are picking "YES", that outcome becomes safer — and the payout gets smaller.
If you're betting against the crowd, your potential payout gets bigger.
