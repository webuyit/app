# GOAT is a gamified, social betting layer built for true sports lovers. It turns raw passion into action. Bet with friends, back your instincts, and feel every moment like never before.

GOAT is a PvP (player vs player) betting platform where fans don’t just bet on teams — they trade athlete performance. You place picks on any real player actions. From goals to Knockouts.

It’s permissionless — meaning anyone can create a market and let others join in. No house. No limits. Just fans betting on greatness.

## 🪙 What is Chaser?

Chaser is the in-app currency used to bet on athletes.

### Here’s how it works:

- Swap your fan tokens into Chaser instantly

- Use **Chaser** to enter markets and place bets

- You can swap back anytime to your original token (like $CHZ or any supported asset)

### Chaser is your game-ready currency — swap in, bet big, cash out.

## 📈 What are Markets?

A Market is a bet on a specific player stat or event.

### It can look like:

- ⚽ Will Mbappé score 2 goals in the first half? → Yes / No

- 🆚 Who scores first: Haaland or Mbappé? → Player Duel

- 🏀 Will LeBron make the next free throw? → Live Market

Each market has 2 or more outcomes. You choose your side using Chasers (our in-app betting token).

If your prediction is correct when the market closes — you win the pot. If you're wrong — your stake goes to the winners.
