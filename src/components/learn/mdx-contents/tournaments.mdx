# A Tournament is a curated collection of markets where players compete for real prizes.

## Here’s how it works:

- 🎯 A tournament creator (e.g. Socios) sets up a series of markets (e.g. 10 markets over 3 weeks)

- 🧠 They choose a scoring type:

- Points-based (earn points per correct pick)

- Wins-based (ranking by most wins)

- 💰 They set the prize pool and how it’s distributed — e.g. Top 5 or Top 10 on the leaderboard

The more accurate your picks, the higher you climb the leaderboard.
At the end, top players take home Chaser or fan token rewards.

## 🎮 Tournament Types

GOAT offers 4 types of tournaments — each with different access rules:

### 🔒 Gated

Only players who hold a specific fan token (and amount) can join.

- Example: Only $PSG holders with 20+ tokens can enter.

### 🎟️ Private

Invitation-only.

- Only users personally invited by the creator can participate.

### 💰 Premium

- Players must pay a set amount of Chaser to join. Higher stakes — bigger rewards.

### 🌍 Open
